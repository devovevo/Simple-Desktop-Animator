# Simple Desktop Animator
 A simple program written in Visual C++ to animate the desktop with an mp4 file of your choice. Made for and on Windows 10 64 bit.

# Source Code
 The source code for this project is entirely included in the src/Source Code folder. The source code is presented as a Visual Studio project, so if you have this installed already simply double click on the Simple Desktop Animator.sln file. If you do not have it installed, install Visual Studio of some edition first. If you are running on a computer that cannot download Visual Studio, the code can be found at src/Source Code/Simple Desktop Animator/Main.cpp.

# For actual use
 If you actually want to use this desktop animator (I think it's pretty cool) simply go to either the src/Executables folder and download the .exe for your architecture (86 or 64 bit). If the .exe file does not run, try downloading the other dll files with it if your computer does not have these libraries.

 Please talk to me about any and all bugs you find (I like feedback).
