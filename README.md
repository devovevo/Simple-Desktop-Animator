# Simple Desktop Animator
 A simple program written in Visual C++ to animate the desktop with an mp4 file of your choice. Made for and on Windows 10 64 bit.

# Source Code
 The source code for this project is entirely included in the src/Source.cpp file for review. This code for some reason will not compile and run for me in Visual Studio Code (I am a newbiew at windows compiling, I've only really used linux) so the way to run and debug this code would be to create a new Console App in Visual Studio and then copy and paste the Source.cpp file into a new .cpp file in the project.

# For actual use
 If you actually want to use this desktop animator (I think it's pretty cool) simply go to either the src/Executable for your architecture (86 or 64 bit), download the executable as well as the linker files (included simply for compatability), run, and upload a file to use for the animator. My preferred framerate is around 500 for 3 x 3 grids of video.

# Bugs
 Please talk to me about any and all bugs you find (I like feedback).
